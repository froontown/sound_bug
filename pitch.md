- Video games and music were always a part of my life
- Serendipitously, I ended up working at LucasArts in SF, which was more than a dream come true
- I learned a tremendous amount about the game development process, and I admired the creativity and problem solving involved
- All the while, I also taught music on the side and continued to learn more instruments
- I wanted to be more involved in the development process, and after moving back home from California, I stumbled upon Launch
- It felt like a great extension from my experience in gaming and my passion for learning
- As I learned some pretty rad stuff at Launch, I had a random idea, and the quick version of it is: Twitter for Musicians. I call it SoundBug.
- The scope of the project is pretty large for someone at my level of experience, so I decided to break it down to manageable components
- The first component I wish to tackle is the social networking aspect, which is my breakable toy
- Users will log in through their Soundcloud accounts and interact with a React-based front end for a dynamic user experience
- Users can upload and share songs, review and comment on them, and create a community of music lovers
- The backend will be handled through Rails and ActiveRecord, where User information will be stored
- The larger overall goal for SoundBug isn't just to share songs, but to create little sound bites to nurture a creative, collaborative community
- The goal for this project is to lay down the groundwork for future expansions in my endeavor to create what I currently imagine

Notes:

* Talk about college education
* Get rid of transition phrases like "all the while," etc.

- Video games and music
- Working at LucasArts = dream come true
- Learned development process
- Worked with like-minded peers who cherished the creative process and problem solving
- Taught music on the side and continued to teach myself
- Wanted to be more directly involved in the development process
- Moved back from California and stumbled upon Launch
- Natural extension from working in games and my passion for learning
- After learning some rad stuff at Launch, had the idea that sums up like Twitter for Musicians called Soundbug
- From previous experience, I'm following a similar structure and breaking down the project to smaller, manageable components
- The first component is the social networking aspect, which is my breakable toy
- Users will log in through Soundcloud and interact with a React-based front end for a dynamic user experience
- Users can post, share, rate, and comment on songs to create a community of music lovers
- Backend = Rails and ActiveRecord where User info will be stored
- The overall goal for SoundBug isn't just to share songs, but to create sound bites to nurture a creative, collaborative community
- My goal for this project has been to lay down the groundwork for future expansions in my endeavor to create when I imagine

Notes:

* What is a dynamic User experience? Why React? (Smoother experience)
* Think like: one sentence describing the technology for non-tech, why you use that technology, what it does for your app
* Try focusing your story from audio engineering to gaming to web development

- Video games and music
- Broke my dad's stereo: became an audio engineer
- Ended up at LucasArts to become an video game audio engineer, but became a QA Lead instead
- Loved the game development process
- Admired my teammates' creativity and problem solving focus
- Wanted to get back to creating my own stuff
- Moved back from California and discovered Launch
- Loved learning about code at Launch
- Had an idea: Twitter for Musicians. SoundBug!
- Decided to break it down to manageable components
- My breakable toy focuses on the sharing, commenting, and voting aspect of SoundBug
- Users can share songs through several forms: simple text, uploading audio files via Wavesurfer, pulling from the Spotify API for a 30 second clip, or sharing a youtube video
- The React-based front end bypasses the need to constantly reload the page, allowing for a smooth, dynamic User experience
- The rails backend will store User information, the upvote/downvote scores for individual songs, and who created each song
- The overall goal for SoundBug is to allow Users to create their own soundbites and nurture a creative, collaborative community
- My project has been to lay down the groundwork for future expansions in my endeavor to creat what I imagine
