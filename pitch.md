- Video games and music were always a part of my life
- Serendipitously, I ended up working at LucasArts in SF, which was more than a dream come true
- I learned a tremendous amount about the game development process, and I admired the creativity and problem solving involved
- All the while, I also taught music on the side and continued to learn more instruments
- I wanted to be more involved in the development process, and after moving back home from California, I stumbled upon Launch
- It felt like a great extension from my experience in gaming and my passion for learning
- As I learned some pretty rad stuff at Launch, I had a random idea, and the quick version of it is: Twitter for Musicians. I call it SoundBug.
- The scope of the project is pretty large for someone at my level of experience, so I decided to break it down to manageable components
- The first component I wish to tackle is the social networking aspect, which is my breakable toy
- Users will log in through their Soundcloud accounts and interact with a React-based front end for a dynamic user experience
- Users can upload and share songs, review and comment on them, and create a community of music lovers
- The backend will be handled through Rails and ActiveRecord, where User information will be stored
- The larger overall goal for SoundBug isn't just to share songs, but to create little sound bites to nurture a creative, collaborative community
- The goal for this project is to lay down the groundwork for future expansions in my endeavor to create what I currently imagine
