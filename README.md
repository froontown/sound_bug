# README

* SoundBug is currently busted. Trying to fix it!

# Known Issues:

* Background image doesn't load on heroku
* Search Bar stopped working once I added React
* Can't get Wavesurfer.js to work yet
* Top Bar disappears unless User shrinks window to medium sized first for some reason, (googling says this might be a bug in Foundation 5)
